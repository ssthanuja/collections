#ABSTRACT
Our study focuses on the causes of flight delays in the United States of America. Our analysis intrigued us to ponder
the reasons for the significant delays in multiple airlines. Hence, our project intended to learn the reasons
contributing to the delay of flights by the airline and focussed more towards the top 10 airlines that had reported delays
in US. An interactive dashboard was developed as a result of this objective. The dashboard serves as a filter to
demonstrate the airline delay across the different states of US. Overall, the project has been specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound by the smart goals.
The result concluded in categorizing the delay caused into one of the two types; man-made or natural.

#Why Airlines Delay Analysis?

The next question arises in one’s mind is “Why Airlines Delay?” In modern times, the aviation industry plays a vital role in the world's transportation sector and a lot of businesses rely on various airlines to connect them with other parts of the world. But, due to extreme weather conditions, technical/manual problems, carrier problems etc., may directly affect the airline services leading to flight delays.

Project Overview
We analyzed a sample dataset with 318,018 records related to airlines delay to find the root cause for the delay and thus analyze which airport has the most delays. As the phrase quotes “time is invaluable,” so in order to save more time by studying delay, this analysis was thus performed.

Objective of the Study
 To analyze the causes of flight delays in the US airlines across the different states/airports using Tableau visualizations. 

Questions Interested - 
1.	What are the reasons for the delays? Is it natural or man-made? 
2.	Are the delays specific to any airplane or airport?
3.	Find the top 10 airplane carriers that face the most delays and compare it with the least delayed carriers. 


SMART Goal:

The goal is to, within 30 days, identify and mitigate airline delays by a 10% reduction; achieved by interacting with airlines, airport authorities and performing a forecast analysis based on the available historical data, and thus minimizing revenue loss incurred on a monthly basis caused due to delays to the airlines.
